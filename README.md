Battleship game in Go 
https://blog.andreev.it/?p=3971
I’ve decided to play with the Go language and what better way to learn than to give yourself a small task and 
see if you can make it. So, I’ve made a small variant of the Battleship game. 
It’s my first project in Go and it can be much better optimized, but hey, it’s my first try. 
Save the source as battleship.go and start with go run battleship.go.
