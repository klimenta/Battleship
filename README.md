# Battleship
Battleship game in Go as descibed here https://blog.andreev.it/?p=3971

I’ve decided to play with the **Go** language and what better way to learn than to give yourself a small task and see if you can make it. 
So, I’ve made a small variant of the Battleship game. 

It’s my first project in **Go** and I am sure it can be much better optimized, but hey, it’s my first try. 

Save the source as **battleship.go** and start with:

```go
go run battleship.go.
```
Then play by guessing coordinates, e.g. A8 or C3.
